# Project-TileCleaner
Final exam-project in C# introduction course from Malm√∂ Universitet, spring 2019. 

The program is a remake of the classic minesweeper, a theme for my programs. It uses Windows Forms in C#, creating the field with buttons. 
Would love feedback for this project, ofc things you think I did good, but mostly things you think I could improve.
